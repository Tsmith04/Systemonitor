# SysteMonitor Environment Control and Tracking System
Hardware/Software project for controlling and monitoring an enclosed system or environment such as animal enclosures, plants/greenhouses, or other applications such as cooking. This system includes a main control hub which can communicate with swappable Bluetooth sensors that are chosen to fit for the system that is being monitored and controlled. 

The main control unit is the same across all configurations, but the peripherals can be customized to fit the scenario. The product has a mobile application and web app that goes along with the system that is used to tell the control hub which sensors are present in the current configuration, and provide control input for the system control devices such as heat lamps, LEDs, coolers, etc.
